## What is UCAN?

**User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN)** is a capability-based authorization system that enables users to delegate permissions without requiring a centralized authority. Built on cryptographic tokens, UCAN allows for:

- **Decentralized Authorization**: No central server required for permission verification
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Delegate specific capabilities with custom constraints  
- **Time-Limited Access**: Set expiration times for temporary permissions
- **Revocable Permissions**: Withdraw access when needed

## Key Features

### Capability-Based Security
UCAN implements the principle of least authority (PoLA) by allowing precise delegation of specific capabilities rather than broad permissions.

### Cryptographic Verification  
All authorizations are cryptographically signed and verifiable without contacting the issuer, enabling offline and distributed authorization.

### Composable Permissions
UCANs can be chained and combined to create complex authorization flows while maintaining security guarantees.

### Standards Compliant
Built on established standards like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for maximum interoperability.

## Use Cases

- **Decentralized Storage**: Authorize access to files and data without centralized servers
- **API Access Control**: Delegate API permissions with rate limiting and scope restrictions  
- **IoT Device Management**: Securely share device control with time-limited access
- **Content Publishing**: Grant publishing rights with content type and duration constraints
- **Resource Sharing**: Enable peer-to-peer sharing of computational resources
